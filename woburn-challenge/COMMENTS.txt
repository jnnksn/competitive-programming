_2019-3-Junior_:
Did not take this contest seriously... I probably comitted less than 50 minutes on this contest and was sick.
Problems seemed good for junior, although it was surprising that I didn't solve J4 while in
contest. Fortunately, I solved it 2 minutes after the contest finished! 
LEARNED:
- Don't be too overconfident, this was a bad performance by me
- Implemented J4 incorrectly... Spend more time on a more efficient solution. 
  Don't go straight to coding.
- Take contests seriously. This is good practice.
